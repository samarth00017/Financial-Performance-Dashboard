# Financial-Performance-Dashboard

This project showcases a Financial Performance Dashboard developed in Power BI to analyze and visualize critical financial metrics. The dashboard provides revenue trends over time, budget vs actual variance, and cash flow analysis to support data-driven decision-making. Users can interact with slicers and filters for dimensions such as time period, region, and department, enabling flexible analysis.

Key KPIs include total revenue, profit margin, budget variance percentage, and net cash flow. The dashboard uses drill-down functionality to explore trends from a high-level summary down to transactional details. Visuals such as line charts, variance graphs, and waterfall charts make it easier to identify financial gaps and growth opportunities.

By consolidating revenue, expenses, and budget data into a single interactive dashboard, the project highlights how Power BI can transform raw financial data into actionable insights for effective financial planning and business performance monitoring.
